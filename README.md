#Furindo frontend-test

In this test, we want you to build a frontend using React with typescript, if you're not familiar enough with typescript you are permissible to use javascript instead.


API = https://fakestoreapi.com/docs (please read the documentation)
(Remember that nothing in real will insert into the database. so if you want to access the new id you will get a 404 error.)

feature requirements:
- a page for user to register/login
- a homepage where user can see all products and when a user clicks a product it will show the product detail in a modal
- if the user is logged in then the user can add new products/update products
- make a frontend side cart ( don't use the cart endpoints )
- if the user want's to checkout the cart while not loggedin, prompt the user to login first.

tech requirements:
- Reactjs
- typescript is preferred but javascript is okay
- make use of https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/reference/useQuery for api calls
- to make sure your react app runs great, make sure to understand and apply your knowledge of memoization in react
- make us of https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/ for ready to use components
